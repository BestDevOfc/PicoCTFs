/*

    Objective: modify the "safe data" using Heap overflow.


    Welcome to heap0!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5a44ccd922b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5a44ccd922d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 2
Data for buffer: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_MODIFIED_DATA_MUHAHAHHA

5. Exit

*** To make this more fun I decided to modify the safe variable specific to what I want instead of random stuff.

In order to do this I subtracted the addresses 
0x5a44ccd922d0 - 0x5a44ccd922b0 = 32 bytes

Every 'A' = 1 byte, so I did 32 of them in succession and then appended my custom data to them to over-write
the safe variable with what I WANT.

    because malloc() is being used and it is dynamic, the data will be put into the HEAP where 
    we will manually interact with it. Moreover, this does not follow LIFO (Last In First Out)
    like the Stack does.

    The Stack stores functions, variables, condiitons, and overwriting the stack 
    allows you to modify return addresses and this can lead to RCE if a function is being 
    unused but we over-write the return address to it (rlly fucking cool).
