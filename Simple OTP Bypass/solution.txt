To bypass the OTP I tried using burp intruder and a range of numbers from 
1-5000, but strings were also accepted, so it was a hope they were numbers.


*This did NOT work, but what did work was simply removing the OTP body parameter and renaming it so 
something else like this:


POST
....
notOTPName=random


and this worked. This is actually a good one because a lot of OTP verifications CAN be bypassed by messing 
with the name, changing it to upper, encoding, setting OTP=True and different data types can also work.
