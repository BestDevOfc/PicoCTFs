This is a good solution, they give you two buttons, one to change the background to "RED" and the 
other to change it to "BLUE". Upon inspecting the requests in burp it turns out the blue is a POST and red is a GET.

The name says get aHEAD, HEAD is a HTTP protocol that acts the same as GET but has a different name.

** THIS IS A GOOD CTF PRACTICE because many CSRF protections can be bypassed by changing the protocols from 
    GET to HEAD, Gitlabs would've had one if they did not do 
    if http.request == GET:
        check CSRF
explicitly!
