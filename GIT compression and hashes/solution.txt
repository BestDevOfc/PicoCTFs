1) grep -ri "pico" .

I found NO FLAG (unlike like last time). So clearly they want us to learn more about the .GIT structure, so I 
took to openai

the reason I did this is because when I checked the logs file I found a commit that said 
"creating flag" and then one right after saying "removing sensitive info", so I knew the commit history
probably uploaded a file that had the flag in it, but this time it was an object.

So I went into the "objects" folder and they were all two character directory names, 
looking closely I realized these correspond to hashes. When I went into the folder
that matched the hash for the "creating flag" commit I found some weird 
encoded file. That's when I realized this is probably compressed.

After openai's prompt it turns out this is how we decompress the GIT data:

"git cat-file -p HASH"
this works on:
- trees
- objects
- everthing with a hash

after following some hashes I found a TXT file, after catting the hash of that file I found the flag.
