so we SSH into the machine and we have a program named "bin".

when doing ./bin it says "error environment variable not set SECRET_DIR".

whatever SECRET_DIR is set to in env variables it will print the files in that directory.

That's when I realized it's probably running "ls $SECRET_DIR".

So I realized it's running ls as root because it was able to list the /root directory and 
I AM NOT (as a ctf-player SUID). Therefore, this binary is running under a GUID (group user id) of ROOT (0).

turns out "ls" can be abused by doing this:

"ls $SECRET_DIR"

$SECRET_DIR = "&& cat /root/flag.txt"

what the program will do:

"ls && cat /root/flag.txt".
Thereforeeee, we now will list the current files (ls), and the "&&" will
run our cat command on /root/flag.txt.

export SECRET_DIR="&& cat /root/flag.txt"
